# Music History

This is the project that you will be working for your individual work throughout the entire front end course. Don't worry, you'll be building lots of other applications, but when you learn a new technique, library or language, you'll be cutting your teeth with it on Music History.

I've started you off with a very basic HTML document, the `index.html` file. This file name is the default file that most any web server looks for in the directory in which is was started. This is why you don't have to type in `www.google.com/index.html`. If the file exists, the web server sends it back to you if you just request the root URL.

> **Terminology:** Root URL simply means your domain name (or IP address) with no other documents, or folders specified. `www.google.com` is the root URL of Google's web site, but `www.google.com/finance` is not.

## Individual Assignment

You will be building the basic structure of your Music History application in HTML and making it look good with the skills you learned in CSS.

Visit the [Music History mockup](https://moqups.com/chortlehoort/1E8LJX7r/) that I created. You will be recreating that document in your own HTML file.

### Criteria 

1. Create five options for the artist select element of any artist that you enjoy.
1. Create at least five options for the album select element. One, or more, album for each artist.
1. The links in the navigation bar don't need to link to anything just yet, you can use `<a href="#">View music</a>` for now
1. Pick your four favorite songs from the artists you have chosen and use the information for each in the list that's on the right-hand side. You can use `h1` tags, `div` tags, `section` tags... whatever you like.

## Completing

Once you are done, make sure you add your files to git, make a commit, and then push your new code up to Github with the following command `git push origin master`.
